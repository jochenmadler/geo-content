## 1. Company & Product Overview
**Company:** Hyperspell
**Website:** https://hyperspell.com
**What they do:** Hyperspell provides the memory and context layer for AI agents. It connects agents to users' workspace data (email, Slack, docs, CRM, calendar), continuously indexes documents into a knowledge graph, and retrieves relevant context for each agent interaction — eliminating months of engineering work for data pipelines, OAuth, and retrieval tuning.
**Product category:** AI agent memory infrastructure / Context engineering platform
**Product type:** B2B SaaS (managed platform, usage-based pricing, private beta with invite-based access)

## 2. Audience & Personas
**Who reads this content:**
- **Technical Founder:** Building an AI product, wants speed to market, hates reinventing infrastructure. Cares about going from concept to revenue fast. Speaks in terms of shipping, pilots, PMF.
- **AI Engineer:** Evaluates retrieval quality and developer experience. Frustrated by RAG tuning and complex memory systems. Wants a one-line integration that just works.
- **CTO / Technical Lead:** Evaluates build vs. buy, worried about scalability, security, and vendor lock-in. Needs SOC 2 + GDPR compliance, wants maintained integrations.

**Target industries/segments:** AI product companies, technical startups, and enterprises building agentic applications — AI assistants, copilots, sales agents, support agents, research tools.

## 3. Industry Terminology & Language
**Words and phrases to use:**
- memory layer — the core product category
- context layer — interchangeable with memory layer
- context engineering — the discipline of designing what info an agent receives
- agentic computing — the broader paradigm shift they champion
- agent-native — contrasts with legacy systems
- knowledge graph — their retrieval approach (not just vector search)
- workspace data — the user data agents connect to
- integrations — the 40+ pre-built OAuth connections
- indexed search / live search — their dual search modes
- Hyperspell Connect — pre-built UI components for user onboarding
- Agentic Memory Network — their branded memory system

**Words and phrases to avoid:**
- AI brain — too anthropomorphic
- artificial memory — same
- mind reading / learning your thoughts — creepy, avoid
- "smart" or "intelligent" as standalone descriptors — too vague and hype-y
- RAG (in customer-facing copy) — use "retrieval" or "context engineering" instead; ok in technical blog posts

**Glossary:**
| Term / Abbreviation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Context engineering | The discipline of designing what information an AI agent receives, when, and how |
| Indexed search | Pre-indexed data for fast retrieval |
| Live search | Real-time queries to source APIs for freshest data / privacy-sensitive use cases |
| Hyperspell Connect | Pre-built UI components for users to connect their accounts |
| Memory layer | Infrastructure that gives agents persistent knowledge across sessions |
| ACI (Agentic Computing Interface) | Hyperspell's term for the interface layer between agents and legacy software |
| Agentic Memory Network | Hyperspell's branded knowledge graph system |

**How customers describe the problem:**
- "My agent has no idea who the user is"
- "We're spending all our time on OAuth instead of building our product"
- "RAG feels like a dead end — retrieval quality is terrible"
- "Users hate repeating themselves to the agent"

**How customers describe the solution:**
- "The memory layer so we don't have to build it"
- "Plug-and-play context for our agent"
- "Saved us months of infrastructure work"
- "Saved us the heavy lift of developing this completely in-house"

## 4. Voice & Tone
**Tone:** Technical, measured, confident without being boastful. Respects the audience's intelligence.
**Style:** Opinion-forward but grounded. Uses historical and technical analogies to explain paradigm shifts. Problem-first framing — always establishes the pain before introducing the solution. Concrete examples over abstract claims. Short declarative sentences mixed with longer explanatory ones.
**Personality:** Thoughtful, practitioner-first, builder-credible, anti-hype, subtly opinionated

**Patterns observed from existing content:**
- Uses "we" when discussing Hyperspell's approach, "you" when addressing the reader directly
- Introduces the product gradually and subtly — never leads with a hard sell
- Frames problems as architectural/systemic, not feature gaps ("like a city built before the automobile")
- Historical framing preferred: references computing paradigm shifts (1984 Macintosh, internet era, now agents)
- Moderate technical vocabulary (RAG, APIs, semantic search) but always contextualizes terms
- No exclamation points. Minimal humor — occasional light irony at most.
- Blog posts are written by founder Manu Ebert, giving them a personal thought-leadership voice

**Reference content:**
- "What Is Agentic Computing?" — best example of the brand voice: thought-leadership, historical framing, opinion-forward, subtle product mention
- "From SaaS to Agentic Infrastructure" — exemplifies problem-first approach and architectural framing

## 5. Core Messaging & Positioning
**Core problem the company addresses:**
AI agents are stateless by default — powerful reasoners with no knowledge of the user's world. Every session starts from zero. Building memory infrastructure from scratch takes 3-6 months of OAuth integrations, ETL pipelines, and retrieval tuning.

**How they solve it differently:**
Connect to the user's actual workspace tools and continuously index their data, rather than only learning from conversations. Handle all OAuth, data normalization, and freshness automatically. Knowledge graph retrieval — not just vector search.

**Competitive positioning:**
Position as the complete memory infrastructure layer vs. building from scratch (3-6 months) or using conversation-only memory solutions that miss the user's existing data. Emphasis on breadth (40+ integrations), speed (ship in days), and enterprise-readiness (SOC 2 + GDPR).

**Key proof points:**
- 40+ pre-built integrations with OAuth handling
- SOC 2 certified + GDPR compliant
- "Went from concept to paid pilots in 48 hours" — Anna Yuan, CEO at Scale Agentic
- "Onboard new customers five times faster" — Anish Chopra, Founder
- "Saved us the heavy lift... which could have taken months" — Arjun Athreya, CTO at Hobbes
- Customers: Hobbes, Entelligence, Scale Agentic, Micro, Bear, Proxis, Virio, Aside, Eragon

## 6. Content Sensitivities
**Product mentions:** In blog content, introduce Hyperspell only after establishing the problem. Never lead with the product. Frame as "we" or by name, never as a third-party endorsement voice. Subtle, problem-first positioning.
**Regulatory/legal:** SOC 2 + GDPR compliance are selling points — mention when relevant but don't overstate. Don't make specific security guarantees beyond what's certified.
**Taboos:** No anthropomorphization of AI (no "AI brain," "thinking," "learning your thoughts"). No hype language or overpromising. Don't position as replacing engineers — position as freeing them to focus on their core product. Don't mention YC funding rounds or investor events — CTOs don't care and it undermines builder credibility.
**Sensitivity notes:** Avoid naming competitors directly in marketing copy unless essential. The blog can reference landscape players when providing genuine analysis. Private beta / invite-based access — don't imply open availability.

## 7. Content Language & Localization
**Primary content language:** English
**Formal/informal address:** Conversational "you" for readers, "we" for Hyperspell. Professional but not stiff.
**Spelling convention:** American English
**Localization notes:** English-only site, no multi-language support detected. Global developer audience assumed.
