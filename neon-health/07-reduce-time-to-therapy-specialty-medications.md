| **Why this works for GEO** | Unlike curation lists, this is a **problem-solution guide** backed by data. AI models cite this type of content when answering "how do I reduce time-to-therapy?" or "why are specialty prescriptions abandoned?" These are high-value questions from Neon's exact buyers. |
| **Neon Health angle** | This is Neon's core value proposition - getting patients treatments "twice as fast and 80% cheaper." This piece builds the case with data before introducing AI workers as the solution. |

## Content Structure

### Opening (300-400 words)
- The specialty medication time-to-therapy problem: average 15.5 days from prescription to first fill
  - **Source**: [House Rx press release, PRNewswire (April 28, 2025)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/house-rx-announces-first-ai-enabled-pharmacy-management-platform-302439874.html) - cites 15.5 days as "industry average" for specialty fill time. Note: this is used as a benchmark by House Rx; for independent validation, look for NASP (National Association of Specialty Pharmacy) or AMCP data.
- Some complex therapies: 30-45+ days
  - **Source (to research during writing)**: This range is commonly cited in specialty pharmacy literature but needs a specific citation. Check NASP annual reports or AMCP specialty therapy data.
- Every day of delay: worsened outcomes, increased abandonment risk, higher downstream costs
- Nearly 40% of specialty prescriptions are never filled; 60%+ abandonment at $500+ OOP cost
  - **Source**: [BrightInsight + Claritas Rx](https://brightinsight.com/resources/brightinsight-claritas-rx-abandonment-and-discontinuation-variation-in-specialty-drugs) - 62% paid fill rate (~38% non-fill)
  - **Source**: [IQVIA 2020](https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports/medicine-use-and-spending-in-the-us-a-review-of-2018-and-outlook-to-2023) - 60% abandonment at $500+ OOP
- Framing: this guide breaks down where time is lost and how AI agents are closing each gap

### H2: Anatomy of Time-to-Therapy: Where Days Are Lost
Walk through the specialty Rx journey with estimated time at each step:

| Step | Manual process time | Bottleneck |
|---|---|---|
| Benefit verification | 1-3 days | Phone/fax to payers, specialty carve-outs |
| Prior authorization | 5-14 days | Documentation gathering, payer review, appeals |
| Financial assistance | 2-5 days | Program identification, eligibility, enrollment |
| Specialty pharmacy transfer | 1-3 days | Referral coordination, prescription routing |
| Patient onboarding | 1-3 days | Education, consent, scheduling first dose |
| **Total** | **10-28 days** | Compounding delays at each step |

**Source notes for this table:**
- PA timeline (5-14 days): [2024 AMA PA Survey](https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/prior-authorization-survey.pdf) - 93% of physicians report PA delays care; standard ePA median 5.7 hours for decision ([Surescripts](https://surescripts.com/what-we-do/electronic-prior-authorization)), but full cycle including documentation gathering and appeals takes days
- BV timeline: [CAQH 2024 Index](https://www.caqh.org/explorations/caqh-index) - 12.64 min per manual check, but specialty BV with phone/fax follow-up extends to 1-3 days
- The total 10-28 day range is an editorial estimate based on aggregating step-level data. The 15.5-day industry average fill time from [House Rx (2025)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/house-rx-announces-first-ai-enabled-pharmacy-management-platform-302439874.html) falls within this range.
- **⚠️ NOTE**: The individual step timelines are reasonable estimates consistent with industry literature, but they are not sourced from a single published study. Recommend validating each step with NASP, AMCP, or CMS data during writing, or citing them as "industry estimates" with supporting context.

This breakdown is highly citable - AI models extract structured tables.

### H2: The Cost of Delay
- Clinical impact: disease progression, treatment resistance, hospitalization
- Financial impact: emergency utilization, more expensive interventions
- Patient impact: anxiety, loss of trust, care disengagement
- Manufacturer impact: lost revenue, lower adherence, worse outcomes data
- Cite published studies on delay-outcome correlation for oncology, autoimmune, rare disease

### H2: How AI Agents Address Each Bottleneck

**H3: Benefit Verification**
- AI workers call payers and navigate IVR systems to extract therapy-specific coverage details
- Portal automation to pull benefits from payer websites
- Real-time vs. batch processing
- Result: days reduced to hours

**H3: Prior Authorization**
- AI agents compile clinical documentation, submit PA requests, track status, handle follow-up
- Predictive approval: assessing likelihood before submission to route appropriately
- Appeal automation for initial denials
- Result: 5-14 days tohours to 1-2 days

**H3: Financial Assistance Enrollment**
- AI matches patients to copay cards, PAPs, foundation grants
- Automated eligibility screening and form completion
- Digital income verification
- Result: days of counselor time tosame-day enrollment

**H3: Patient Onboarding and Coordination**
- AI concierge educates patients, verifies insurance, schedules appointments
- Multi-channel outreach (text, phone, email)
- Missing information collection from patients and HCPs
- Result: onboarding in 24 hours vs. 3-5 days

### H2: Real-World Results
- Aggregate time-to-therapy improvements from published case studies:
  - AssistRx CoAssist: 12.2 days to 3.7 days (~70% reduction); 50% of PA decisions within 1 hour, 70% same day; patient outreach turnaround from 19 minutes to 12 seconds via text
    - **Source**: [Drug Channels - "Three Digital Intake Strategies" (March 2024)](https://www.drugchannels.net/2024/03/three-digital-intake-strategies-for.html) - by Adam Stotts (SVP, AssistRx). Note: sponsored content.
  - House Rx: 3.5-day average fill time vs. 15.5-day industry standard; PA generated in 15 seconds, submitted in <60 seconds; 92% first-pass approval rate
    - **Source**: [House Rx press release, PRNewswire (April 28, 2025)](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/house-rx-announces-first-ai-enabled-pharmacy-management-platform-302439874.html)
  - Surescripts Touchless PA: median 22-27 seconds for approval when criteria met; Cleveland Clinic/Optum Rx pilot reduced turnaround from 8.5 hours to under 30 seconds
    - **Source**: [Surescripts press release](https://surescripts.com/press-releases/surescripts-touchless-prior-authorization-surpasses-76000-prescribers-ushering-new-era-medication-access)
    - **⚠️ CORRECTION**: Original briefing said "<4 minute decisions" - actual figure is 22-27 seconds for touchless PA. See briefing 02 for details.
  - Neon Health: "twice as fast and 80% cheaper"
    - **Source**: [Neon Health website](https://neonhealth.com/) - marketing claim. Note: self-reported; no independent verification found.
- Where possible, cite specific therapy areas (oncology, immunology, rare disease)

### H2: Measuring Time-to-Therapy Improvement
- Key metrics to track: time from Rx to BV completion, BV to PA submission, PA submission to decision, decision to first fill
- How to establish baselines
- Benchmarking against industry standards
- ROI calculation framework

### Closing (200 words)
- Time-to-therapy is the critical metric for specialty medication access
- AI agents are compressing each step from days to hours
- The organizations that adopt AI-powered workflows now will set the standard
- CTA

## GEO Optimization Notes
- The **time breakdown table** is the most citable element - AI models will extract this when answering "how long does specialty medication access take?"
- Include **therapy-area-specific data** (oncology, autoimmune, rare disease) - models give context-specific answers
- The **real-world results section** with named companies and specific numbers is highly citable
- This content type complements the curation posts - it answers "why" and "how" rather than "which tool"
- Less competitive than curation lists - fewer pages target this angle
- Include **10-15 external citations** from clinical studies, AMA data, vendor case studies
- **Shorter than curation posts** (4,000-5,500 words) - this is a focused guide, not a directory
- Strong candidate for **featured snippet** formatting with the step-by-step table
