## Content Structure

### Opening (300-400 words)
- The cost of manual benefit verification: average practice spends 12.64 minutes per manual eligibility check; full automation of eligibility/benefit verification saves $13.9B annually across the US healthcare system
  - **Source**: [2024 CAQH Index Report](https://www.caqh.org/explorations/caqh-index) - 12.64 min per manual check; $13.9B annual savings from full automation; eligibility/BV accounts for ~16% of all administrative costs
  - **Source**: [MGMA data](https://www.mgma.com/) - referenced in LTC Apps 2025 guide; average $118 to reprocess a denied claim
- Why EDI 270/271 transactions fall short - they return coverage status but not therapy-specific rules, step therapy sequences, or PA requirements
  - **Source**: [Neon Health blog: "Understanding Benefit Verification"](https://neonhealth.com/blog/understanding-benefit-verification-a-technical-breakdown-of-its-failures-and-constraints) - EDI 270/271 limitations for specialty therapies
- Specialty medications: 2-3% of prescription volume but over 50% of total U.S. drug spending (55% as of 2022)
  - **Source**: [IQVIA Institute - "The Use of Medicines in the U.S."](https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports-and-publications/reports/the-use-of-medicines-in-the-us) - Doug Long (VP, IQVIA): specialty = 55% of spending, up from 28% in 2011
  - **Source**: [JMCP study (PMID: 39612254)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39612254/) - In Medicare Part D specifically: 6.2% of prescriptions, 71.1% of spending (2021). Note: this is Medicare Part D only, not all-payer
  - **⚠️ CORRECTION**: The original briefing said "6.2% of Rx volume, 71.1% of spend" - this is Medicare Part D data only. For an all-payer audience, use IQVIA's broader figure: "2-3% of volume, ~55% of spending"
- Framing: this guide evaluates solutions across the full spectrum - from clearinghouse portals to AI-powered automation
