## Content Structure

### Opening (300-400 words)
- Healthcare call centers face chronic staffing shortages and are a leading source of patient friction
  - **⚠️ REMOVED**: Original briefing claimed "70%+ of patient interactions" go through call centers - no source found for this specific figure. Replace with a defensible framing about call center volume/importance.
  - **Source (to cite)**: [AHA workforce data](https://www.aha.org/) - healthcare workforce shortages; or [Dialog Health call center statistics](https://www.dialoghealth.com/post/healthcare-call-center-statistics) for call center-specific benchmarks
- Average cost per complex healthcare call: $7-$15 per interaction (due to HIPAA compliance, call complexity, and training requirements)
  - **Source**: [Wantek/iwantek.com call center pricing guide (Oct 2025)](https://www.iwantek.com/blogs/news/call-center-pricing-average-cost-per-call-outsourcing) - $8-$15+ for complex compliance-heavy calls
  - **Source**: [Callin.io (March 2025)](https://callin.io/average-cost-per-call-inbound-call-center/) - financial services and healthcare: $7-$9 per interaction; healthcare adds 15-30% compliance premium
  - **⚠️ NOTE**: The "<$1 for AI-handled interactions" claim needs a source. Vendor claims exist (EliseAI, Hyro) but no independent benchmark. Recommend framing as "vendors report 80-95% cost reduction per interaction" rather than a specific dollar figure.
- AI voice agents now handle scheduling, eligibility checks, refill reminders, and benefit verification calls
- The shift: from IVR menus and hold queues to conversational AI that resolves issues on first contact

### H2: What AI Healthcare Call Center Software Does
- Inbound: patient scheduling, appointment changes, billing questions, Rx refill requests
- Outbound: appointment reminders, refill reminders, benefit verification calls to payers, care coordination follow-ups
- Multi-channel: voice, SMS, chat, email
- Integration: EHR, PM, pharmacy systems, payer portals
- Key capabilities: natural language understanding, intent recognition, live agent handoff, multi-lingual support
