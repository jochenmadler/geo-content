# Neon Health - Content Strategy for AI Search Visibility

## TL;DR

We analyzed 1,200 AI-generated answers across patient access queries and identified which pages get cited most. The winning format: **comprehensive comparison pages with named platforms, data tables, and 5,000-9,000 words.** One company (IntuitionLabs) dominates citations with exactly this format. Neon Health has zero pages competing.

We also incorporated keyword research from Neon's SEO agency to cover the full buyer journey - not just vendor comparisons but also problem-aware and category-level content.

11 content pieces. All publish to `neonhealth.com/blog/`.

## The 11 Pieces

### Vendor Comparison Content (buyer comparing solutions)

| # | Title | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Top Insurance Eligibility & Benefit Verification Software Compared** | 3 of top 6 most-cited pages are BV listicles. Neon's core product. |

| 6 | **Specialty Pharmacy Management Platforms Compared** | Competing with **#1 most-cited page in entire dataset** (230 citations). |
| 8 | **Patient Onboarding Automation Software** | 4th largest topic cluster. Gap for specialty onboarding. |

### Problem-Aware Content (buyer experiencing pain, not yet shopping)

| # | Title | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 9 | **How to Reduce Prior Authorization Delays** | Top pain point for Neon's buyer. Practical strategies, funnels to #2. |

## What "Good" Looks Like

The top performer (IntuitionLabs' specialty pharmacy page) gets **230 AI citations across 68 AI-generated answers.** Common patterns:

- 5,000-10,000 words
- 10-15 named platforms with consistent profile structure
- Comparison tables (AI models extract these directly)
- 15-20+ external citations to studies, press releases, CMS data
- Author attribution with credentials
- Publication date + last-updated date visible
- Balanced tone - not a sales pitch

## What Neon Needs to Fix First

Before publishing, address these technical issues (detailed in the [full audit](../seo-audit-neonhealth.md)):

1. **www vs. non-www** - Google has indexed both. Pick one, redirect the other.
2. **Unique title tags** - every page currently shows the same title.
3. **Meta descriptions** - none detected on any page.
4. **Schema markup** - add BlogPosting JSON-LD to every post.

Without these, even great content won't get properly indexed.
