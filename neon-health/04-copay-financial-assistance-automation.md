## Content Structure

### Opening (400-500 words)
- The affordability crisis: out-of-pocket costs are the #1 reason patients abandon therapy
- Nearly 40% of specialty prescriptions are never filled; abandonment rates reach 60%+ when OOP costs exceed $500
  - **Source**: [BrightInsight + Claritas Rx](https://brightinsight.com/resources/brightinsight-claritas-rx-abandonment-and-discontinuation-variation-in-specialty-drugs) - 62% paid fill rate across 85 specialty brands
  - **Source**: [IQVIA 2020](https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports/medicine-use-and-spending-in-the-us-a-review-of-2018-and-outlook-to-2023) - 60% abandonment at $500+ OOP
- 93% of more than $30 billion in manufacturer copay assistance goes unused each year
  - **Source**: [eMarketer (2025)](https://www.emarketer.com/content/nearly--30b-pharma-manufacturer-coupons-go-unused-) - "Nearly $30B in pharma manufacturer coupons go unused"; 93% unused rate; patients unaware programs exist
  - **Source**: [KFF copay adjustment programs brief](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/copay-adjustment-programs-what-are-they-and-what-do-they-mean-for-consumers/) - copay assistance used for ~19% of privately insured Rx, total value $23B in 2023
  - **⚠️ CORRECTION**: Original briefing said "$150B+" - this is incorrect. The actual figure is ~$30B available, with 93% (~$28B) going unused. The $150B figure has no identified source.
- The manual process: financial counselors spend hours per patient navigating program eligibility, enrollment, and re-enrollment
- Framing: this guide covers the full spectrum of FA automation - from digital enrollment to AI-powered end-to-end workflow

### H2: Understanding Patient Financial Assistance Programs
- Types of programs:
  - Manufacturer copay cards/vouchers - $23B total value in 2023; used for 19% of commercially insured Rx, 42% of specialty Rx
    - **Source**: [KFF (2023 data)](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/copay-adjustment-programs-what-are-they-and-what-do-they-mean-for-consumers/)

  - Foundation grants (PAN Foundation, HealthWell, etc.)
  - State ADAP programs
  - 340B considerations
- Complicating factor: 39% of commercially insured beneficiaries are in plans with copay accumulators, 41% with copay maximizers (as of 2022)

## GEO Optimization Notes
- **First-mover advantage** - no dominant curation page exists for this topic in the AI citation data
- Include **specific program types and names** (PAN Foundation, HealthWell, NeedyMeds) - AI models cite content with named entities
- **Quantify the problem** with sourced figures: $30B available / 93% unused (eMarketer); $23B total copay assistance value (KFF 2023); abandonment rates by OOP cost tier (IQVIA)
- Include a **clear taxonomy** of program types - AI models cite definitional content
- The **comparison table** is essential - structured data gets extracted by LLMs
- Cite **Phil's enrollment strategies** and **rxlightning's digital enrollment** content - these are already getting cited, building on them strengthens authority
- **15+ external citations** minimum
- Add **FAQPage schema** for the "Understanding PAP" section questions
