# Content Briefing: Patient Hub Platforms Compared

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Target URL** | `/blog/patient-hub-platforms-compared` |
| **Format** | Blog post (Comparison playbook) |
| **H1** | Patient Hub Platforms Compared: CareMetx, AssistRx, Phil, Lash Group, and Alternatives |
| **Target word count** | 7,000-9,000 words |
| **Primary keyword** | patient hub platforms |
| **Secondary keywords** | patient hub comparison, patient services hub, patient support platform, CareMetx vs AssistRx, best patient hub software, pharma patient hub |
| **Search intent** | Commercial investigation - pharma teams evaluating hub partners |
| **Target persona** | VP of patient services at pharma/biotech, specialty pharmacy directors, patient access strategy leads |
| **Competitive references** | [intuitionlabs patient hub comparison (44 AI answers, 88 citations)](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/patient-hub-platform-comparison), [intuitionlabs PDF comparison (18 AI answers)](https://intuitionlabs.ai/pdfs/comparing-patient-hubs-caremetx-assistrx-phil-lash-group.pdf) |
| **Why this works for GEO** | The intuitionlabs comparison is the 8th most-cited page in the entire dataset. Pharma companies constantly ask AI models "which patient hub should I use?" - there's room for a more comprehensive, updated version. |
| **Neon Health angle** | Neon's AI workforce model is a direct alternative to traditional patient hubs. This piece lets Neon define the category while positioning its approach as the next evolution. |

## Content Structure

### Opening (400-500 words)
- The patient hub market: projected growth, number of specialty therapies requiring hub services
  - **Source (to research during writing)**: Verify current market size estimates from Grand View Research, Allied Market Research, or similar. The pharma patient services/hub market is typically cited at $2-4B+; confirm with a current report.
- Why hubs exist: specialty medications require benefit verification, PA, financial assistance, onboarding, adherence - all coordinated
- The problem: nearly 40% of specialty prescriptions are never filled, driven by insurance barriers, financial burden, and logistical complexity
  - **Source**: [BrightInsight + Claritas Rx](https://brightinsight.com/resources/brightinsight-claritas-rx-abandonment-and-discontinuation-variation-in-specialty-drugs) - 62% paid fill rate across 85 specialty brands (~38% non-fill)
  - **Source**: [IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports/medicine-use-and-spending-in-the-us-a-review-of-2018-and-outlook-to-2023) - 9% overall Rx abandonment; 60% at $500+ OOP
  - **⚠️ NOTE**: Neon Health's marketing uses "42%+" - not traceable to a specific published study. Use "nearly 40%" with BrightInsight source, or cite the cost-stratified IQVIA data for nuance.
- Framing: this guide compares established hubs, digital-native platforms, and AI-powered alternatives

### H2: What Is a Patient Hub Platform?
- Definition and core functions (BV, PA, financial assistance, onboarding, care coordination, adherence)
- Who uses them (pharma manufacturers, specialty pharmacies, health systems)
- How they're deployed (white-label vs. branded, integrated vs. standalone)
- Key evaluation criteria (speed, patient experience, data transparency, scalability)

### H2: The Patient Hub Landscape: Three Generations
- **Generation 1: Call-center hubs** (Lash Group, EVERSANA) - human-driven, proven but expensive
- **Generation 2: Digital-native hubs** (Phil, CareMetx, AssistRx) - tech-enabled, better UX, still human-heavy
- **Generation 3: AI-powered patient access** (Neon Health, Infinitus, Tandem) - AI workers handling end-to-end workflows
- This framing establishes a narrative arc without being overtly promotional

### H2: Patient Hub Platform Profiles

For each platform, consistent structure:

**H3: [Platform Name]**
- Founded / HQ / ownership
- Core capabilities
- Technology approach
- Key differentiator
- Performance data (time-to-therapy, enrollment rates, etc.)
- Best for: [type of program/therapy area]
- Limitations

**Platforms to include:**
1. Lash Group (Cencora) - largest traditional hub
2. CareMetx - founded 2011, mid-market focus
3. AssistRx - iAssist/CoAssist platform, time-to-therapy reduced from 12.2 days to 3.7 days (~70% reduction)
   - **Source**: [Drug Channels - "Three Digital Intake Strategies" (March 2024)](https://www.drugchannels.net/2024/03/three-digital-intake-strategies-for.html) - authored by Adam Stotts, SVP Customer Success at AssistRx. Note: sponsored guest post on Drug Channels, not independent research.
4. Phil - digital-first, PHIL Direct (DTP 2.0)
5. EVERSANA - full-service with RPA
6. CoverMyMeds (McKesson) - pharmacy-integrated affordability
7. Neon Health - AI workers, modular components
8. Tandem - AI medication access workflow
9. Annexus Health - financial assistance focus
10. RxLightning - specialty enrollment digitization

- Total cost of ownership vs. per-patient pricing

### H2: The Shift from Hubs to AI-Powered Patient Access
- Why traditional hub models struggle to scale (staffing, turnover, training)
- How AI workers handle repetitive tasks (voice calls, portal navigation, document submission)
- Hybrid models: AI + human exception handling
- What this means for pharma patient services strategy

### Closing (200 words)
- The hub model is evolving - one-size-fits-all is giving way to modular, AI-driven approaches
- CTA

## GEO Optimization Notes
- The top competitor (intuitionlabs) uses **executive summary + deep profiles + comparative analysis** - mirror this structure but be more comprehensive (add more platforms)
- Include **specific founding dates, HQ locations, ownership** - AI models extract entity facts
- **Performance metrics are critical** - every quantitative claim gets cited (e.g., AssistRx's "12.2 days to 3.7 days" stat appears in AI answers)
- The **"three generations" framing** gives AI models a narrative framework to cite
- Include **20+ external citations** - vendor press releases, industry reports, case studies
- **9,776 words** in the top competitor - match or exceed depth
- Add **JSON-LD BlogPosting schema** with author, datePublished, dateModified
