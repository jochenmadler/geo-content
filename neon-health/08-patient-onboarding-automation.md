| **H1** | Patient Onboarding Automation: Top Software for Faster Therapy Starts [2026] |
| **Target word count** | 5,000-6,500 words |
| **Primary keyword** | patient onboarding automation |
| **Secondary keywords** | patient onboarding software, automated patient intake, patient enrollment automation, digital patient onboarding healthcare, patient intake software |
| **Search intent** | Commercial investigation - teams looking to automate onboarding |
| **Target persona** | Practice managers, specialty pharmacy coordinators, pharma patient services leads, health system IT directors |
| **Competitive references** | [nexhealth patient intake (49 AI answers)](https://www.nexhealth.com/resources/patient-intake-software), [kyruushealth patient intake (36 AI answers)](https://kyruushealth.com/top-digital-patient-intake-software-solutions/), [softwarefinder patient intake (24 AI answers)](https://softwarefinder.com/resources/top-patient-intake-software), [flowforma onboarding automation (16 AI answers)](https://www.flowforma.com/demo-library/how-to-automate-patient-onboarding), [moxo onboarding (16 AI answers)](https://www.moxo.com/blog/patient-onboarding) |
| **Why this works for GEO** | Patient intake/onboarding is the 4th highest topic cluster in the dataset. 5 pages get cited. The existing content focuses on general intake (forms, check-in) - there's a gap for **specialty medication onboarding** which is more complex and more aligned with Neon's product. |
| **Neon Health angle** | Neon's AI concierge handles patient onboarding: education, insurance verification, appointment scheduling, missing information collection. Specialty medication onboarding is far more complex than standard practice intake - Neon can own this sub-category. |

## Content Structure

### Opening (300-400 words)
- Patient onboarding is where therapy starts - or where it stalls
- For specialty medications: onboarding involves insurance verification, PA, financial assistance, clinical education, consent, scheduling, and coordination across multiple parties
- Difference between general practice intake (demographics, forms) and specialty medication onboarding (multi-step, multi-party, multi-week)
- The cost of poor onboarding: abandonment, delayed therapy, patient confusion, staff burnout
- Framing: this guide covers onboarding automation across the full spectrum - from digital intake forms to AI-powered concierge workflows

### H2: General Practice Intake vs. Specialty Medication Onboarding
- Table comparing:

| Dimension | General intake | Specialty medication onboarding |
|---|---|---|
| Duration | 5-15 minutes | 1-4 weeks |
| Steps | Forms, insurance card, consent | BV, PA, FA, education, scheduling, coordination |
| Parties involved | Patient + front desk | Patient + provider + payer + pharmacy + manufacturer |
| Technology | Digital forms, kiosk | Multi-system orchestration, voice AI, portal automation |
| Failure mode | Wait time | Therapy abandonment |

This distinction is a unique angle - competitors don't differentiate clearly.

### H2: Measuring Onboarding Performance
- Time from referral to first treatment
- Onboarding completion rate (% of referred patients who start therapy)
- Patient satisfaction (NPS, surveys)
- Staff time per patient onboarded
- Number of manual touchpoints per patient

### Closing (200 words)
- Patient onboarding is the most underautomated step in the care journey
- For specialty medications, the complexity makes automation both harder and more impactful

## GEO Optimization Notes
- The **general vs. specialty onboarding table** is a differentiator - no competitor makes this distinction clearly
- Including **both general intake and specialty onboarding** platforms captures a wider query set while positioning Neon in the more complex (higher-value) category
- The **step-by-step workflow** section is highly citable - AI models use this structure when explaining onboarding processes
- Include **12-15 external citations**: vendor case studies, AHA reports, healthcare workflow studies
- The competitors (nexhealth, kyruushealth) focus on simple intake - beating them means covering their ground AND going deeper into specialty
- Add **FAQPage schema** for common questions (e.g., "What is patient onboarding in healthcare?")
