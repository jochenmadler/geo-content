### H2: Prescription Abandonment by the Numbers

Present a definitive data picture. This section is designed to be the citation target.

**Overall abandonment rates:**
- All prescriptions: ~9% abandonment rate
  - **Source**: [IQVIA 2020](https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports/medicine-use-and-spending-in-the-us-a-review-of-2018-and-outlook-to-2023)
- Specialty prescriptions: ~38% non-fill rate (62% paid fill rate across 85 specialty brands)
  - **Source**: [BrightInsight + Claritas Rx](https://brightinsight.com/resources/brightinsight-claritas-rx-abandonment-and-discontinuation-variation-in-specialty-drugs)
- 40% of non-life-saving specialty drugs cluster between 40-50% conversion rate
  - **Source**: Same BrightInsight analysis

**Abandonment by out-of-pocket cost:**

| OOP cost tier | Abandonment rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| $0 (free) | ~5% | IQVIA 2020 |
| $0-$50 | 1.3%-10% | JMCP systematic review |
| $100+ | 32%-75% | JMCP systematic review |
| $500+ | ~60% | IQVIA 2020 |

- **Source**: [IQVIA 2020](https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports/medicine-use-and-spending-in-the-us-a-review-of-2018-and-outlook-to-2023)
- **Source**: [JMCP systematic review (2023)](https://www.jmcp.org/doi/10.18553/jmcp.2023.29.5.449) - "The association between cost sharing, prior authorization, and specialty drug utilization"

**Abandonment by therapy area (where data is available):**
- Oral oncolytics: up to 67% abandonment
- Anti-inflammatory (autoimmune): up to 52.3% abandonment
  - **Source**: [JMCP 2023 - Copay assistance use and prescription abandonment (DOI: 10.18553/jmcp.2023.22288)](https://www.jmcp.org/doi/10.18553/jmcp.2023.22288) - cites prior research showing "prescription abandonment for specialty drugs, such as oral oncolytics and anti-inflammatory drugs, to be as high as 67% and 52.3%, respectively." See also: [Dusetzina et al. 2018, JCO](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2017.74.5091) for oral anticancer agent data.
  - **⚠️ CORRECTION**: Original briefing cited PMID 19803554 (Gleason et al. 2009), which only studied TNF blockers and MS biologics - not oncolytics or anti-inflammatory drugs. Source corrected to the JMCP 2023 study that explicitly reports these therapy-area figures.
- Research additional therapy-area data during writing (check CoverMyMeds Medication Access Report, NASP data, IQVIA therapy-specific reports)

**The deductible effect:**
- Specialty therapies are abandoned most frequently during the deductible period of patients' health plans, when OOP costs spike

### H2: The Three Root Causes of Prescription Abandonment

**H3: 1. Financial barriers (cost)**
- Out-of-pocket costs are the single largest driver of abandonment
- Specialty drugs: OOP costs can exceed $500/month for a meaningful share of commercially insured patients (6-7%+ per drug; median OOP is often lower due to copay assistance and plan design, but patients without assistance face the full coinsurance on drugs averaging $78,000/year)
  - **Source**: [AJMC - Cost Sharing for Oral Lenvatinib](https://www.ajmc.com/view/cost-sharing-for-oral-lenvatinib-among-commercially-insured-patients) (6.7% of patients had >$500/month OOP); [CoverMyMeds 2020 Medication Access Report](https://insights.covermymeds.com/medication-access-report/2020/specialty-patient-support) ($78,000 average annual specialty drug cost)
  - **⚠️ NOTE**: Original briefing said "median OOP can exceed $500/month" - "median" is inaccurate. Most commercially insured patients have lower median OOP due to copay cards and plan subsidies, but the high-OOP cohort drives the abandonment problem.
- $30B in manufacturer copay assistance is available, but 93% goes unused
  - **Source**: [eMarketer (2025)](https://www.emarketer.com/content/nearly--30b-pharma-manufacturer-coupons-go-unused-)
- Copay accumulators and maximizers compound the problem: 39% of commercial beneficiaries now in plans with accumulators, 41% with maximizers
  - **Source**: [JMCP primer (2024)](https://www.jmcp.org/doi/10.18553/jmcp.2024.30.8.883)
- Solutions: proactive financial assistance screening, automated copay card enrollment, foundation grant matching, real-time pharmacy benefit check at point of prescribing

**H3: 2. Administrative barriers (PA delays, paperwork, coordination)**
- Prior authorization delays are the second-largest driver: 93% of physicians say PA delays care
  - **Source**: [2024 AMA survey](https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/prior-authorization-survey.pdf)
- Complex specialty workflows involve 4-6 parties (patient, prescriber, payer, pharmacy, manufacturer, sometimes hub)
- Missing documentation, referral routing errors, and phone/fax-based communication create friction at every step
- Solutions: ePA adoption, AI-powered PA automation, streamlined referral intake, multi-channel patient communication
- Link to briefing #9 (reduce PA delays) for detailed strategies

**H3: 3. Patient-level barriers (confusion, fear, logistics)**
- Patients don't understand their diagnosis, their medication, or the process for starting treatment
- Fear of side effects, especially for injectable biologics and oncology treatments
- Logistical barriers: specialty pharmacy not near home, infusion center scheduling, travel requirements
- Solutions: patient education at point of prescribing, concierge onboarding, proactive outreach via text/phone, simplified scheduling

### H2: Who Bears the Cost of Abandonment?

Break down the impact by stakeholder - this multi-perspective approach is highly citable:

- **Patients**: Disease progression, hospitalization, worse long-term outcomes
- **Providers**: Lost revenue from unfilled prescriptions, quality metric impact, care gap documentation burden
- **Pharma manufacturers**: Lost commercial revenue, worse outcomes data for therapies, higher cost per patient start
- **Payers**: Higher downstream costs from emergency utilization, hospitalizations, and disease progression
- **Health system**: Readmissions, ED utilization, quality penalties

### H2: Solutions - Mapped to Each Root Cause

| Root cause | Solution | Who implements | Technology |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cost - patient unaware of assistance | Proactive financial assistance screening at intake | Hub / patient services | FA automation software |
| Cost - copay too high | Automated copay card + foundation grant enrollment | Hub / pharmacy | FA platforms (Neon, Atlas, Annexus) |
| Cost - accumulator/maximizer impact | Real-time benefit check + alternative program matching | Hub / pharmacy | BV + FA integration |
| PA delays - slow submission | Electronic PA / AI-powered PA automation | Provider / hub | ePA platforms (briefing #2) |
| PA delays - documentation gaps | Pre-built clinical documentation packages by therapy | Provider | EHR templates + AI |
| PA delays - denial/appeal cycle | Automated appeal with additional clinical evidence | Hub / provider | PA automation |
| Patient confusion - no education | Structured onboarding with education delivery | Hub / care team | Onboarding automation (briefing #8) |
| Patient fear - side effects | Nurse-led or AI-led pre-treatment counseling | Care team / hub | Care management |
| Logistics - scheduling/access | Concierge scheduling, home infusion coordination | Hub / pharmacy | Patient communication AI |

### H2: Measuring Abandonment - Metrics That Matter
- **Primary metric**: Paid fill rate (% of prescriptions that result in a filled, paid claim)
- **Supporting metrics**: Time from Rx to first fill, financial assistance enrollment rate, PA approval rate (first-pass), patient outreach completion rate
- How to establish a baseline: pharmacy claims data, hub reporting, EHR prescription tracking
- Benchmarking: BrightInsight data as a starting point (62% average paid fill rate for specialty)

### Closing (200 words)
- Prescription abandonment is the ultimate failure metric for patient access - every abandoned prescription represents a patient who needed treatment and didn't get it
- The causes are well-understood (cost, PA delays, patient barriers) and the solutions exist - the question is execution
- CTA: link to Neon's comparison content for readers ready to evaluate automation tools, or demo page for readers ready to act

## GEO Optimization Notes
- The **abandonment-by-cost-tier table** is the single most citable element in all 11 briefings. AI models need this data constantly and no single page consolidates it today.
- The **therapy-area abandonment data** (67% oncolytics, 52.3% anti-inflammatory) will be cited in therapy-specific AI answers
- The **three root causes framework** gives AI models a structured way to explain abandonment - they will adopt and cite this taxonomy
- The **solutions-mapped-to-causes table** is uniquely actionable - AI models cite content that provides structured recommendations
- This page becomes the **anchor for Neon's "42%" narrative** - by consolidating better-sourced data (~38% non-fill, 60% at $500+ OOP), Neon can reference its own authoritative page instead of an unsourced marketing claim
- **15+ external citations** from IQVIA, BrightInsight, AMA, JMCP, CoverMyMeds, eMarketer
- Add **BlogPosting schema** + **FAQPage schema** for: "What is the prescription abandonment rate?" "Why don't patients fill their prescriptions?" "What causes prescription abandonment?"
- Internal links to: briefing #2 (ePA), #4 (financial assistance), #7 (time-to-therapy), #8 (onboarding), #9 (PA delays)
